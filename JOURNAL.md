### 🗓️ August 10, 2025

#### ✅ **Completed Problems**
**Platform:** LeetCode
**Topic:** Strings, Arrays

| Problem | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 5 - Longest Palindromic Substring | ✅ Solved | Expand-around-center approach |
| 238 - Product of Array Except Self | ✅ Solved | Prefix and postfix accumulation |

- Prep optimized sliding window for 76 (window counts + need/have tracking)

### 🗓️ August 11, 2025

#### ✅ **Completed Problems**
**Platform:** LeetCode
**Topic:** Strings, Arrays

| Problem | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 53 - Maximum Subarray | ✅ Solved | Kadane's algorithm (running max) |
| 15 - 3Sum | ✅ Solved | Sort + two-pointer sweep with duplicate skipping |
| 76 - Minimum Window Substring | ⏰ TLE | Needs optimized sliding window with frequency counts |


#### 🎯 **Key Learnings**
- Reinforced two-pointer after sorting (duplicate handling is key)
- Kadane's algorithm for O(n) max subarray
- Naive inclusion checks cause TLE for 76; need character frequency maps

#### 🔄 **Next Steps**
- Implement optimized 76 using window frequency maps and a satisfied-need counter
- Do 1-2 more sliding window problems for practice
