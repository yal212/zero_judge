LeetCode Trees to Mastery Roadmap

🌱 Phase 1: Foundations

Before solving problems, make sure you’re comfortable with:
	•	Tree terminology (root, leaf, height, depth, subtree, binary vs. n-ary trees).
	•	Binary Tree Node definition: class TreeNode { val; left; right; }.
	•	Recursion basics (since most tree problems rely on it).

📌 Start with:
	•	LC 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
	•	LC 100. Same Tree
	•	LC 101. Symmetric Tree

⸻

🌿 Phase 2: Traversals (Core Skills)

Learn DFS (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder) and BFS (Level Order). Try both recursion and iteration.

📌 Problems:
	•	[LC 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal]
	•	[LC 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal]
	•	[LC 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal]
	•	[LC 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal]
	•	[LC 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II]

⸻

🌳 Phase 3: Tree Properties & Construction

Understand height, diameter, balance, path sums, building trees from traversals.

📌 Problems:
	•	[LC 110. Balanced Binary Tree]
	•	[LC 543. Diameter of Binary Tree]
	•	[LC 112. Path Sum]
	•	[LC 113. Path Sum II]
	•	[LC 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum] ⭐
	•	[LC 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal]
	•	[LC 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal]

⸻

🌲 Phase 4: Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

BSTs are everywhere. Focus on search, insertion, deletion, validation.

📌 Problems:
	•	[LC 98. Validate Binary Search Tree]
	•	[LC 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree]
	•	[LC 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree]
	•	[LC 450. Delete Node in a BST]
	•	[LC 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST]
	•	[LC 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST]

⸻

🌴 Phase 5: Advanced Applications

These require combining tree knowledge with DP, DFS backtracking, or graphs.

📌 Problems:
	•	[LC 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree]
	•	[LC 199. Binary Tree Right Side View]
	•	[LC 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes]
	•	[LC 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree] ⭐
	•	[LC 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree]
	•	[LC 1245. Tree Diameter]

⸻

🌾 Phase 6: Patterns & Hard Problems

At this stage, focus on generalizing patterns:
	•	Subtree problems (LC 572, LC 337 House Robber III)
	•	Tree + DP (LC 968. Binary Tree Cameras, LC 124)
	•	Tree + Graph (LC 863, LC 742)

🚀 Study Strategy
	1.	One category at a time → Don’t jump around.
	2.	Draw trees on paper → It clarifies recursion.
	3.	Code DFS in all 3 orders (pre/in/post) → Build muscle memory.
	4.	Review frequently → Many problems are pattern-based.
